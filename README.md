# Tools for Unity

## Overview

This is a personal collection of general purpose scripts and tools for Unity. The code in this project is not for any particular purpose, it 
is just code that I have needed at some point and have decided to clean up for future re-use. This package exists purely for my own personal
convenience, and I cannot attest to the functionality or efficiency of any of it. I also regularly refactor and change the interfaces of its 
tools, so I would not recommend using it as whole for anything professional or long-term. However, if you do find any parts of it 
useful, feel free to copy them and use them for yourself.

## Installation

All packages here can be installed using Unity's built in package manager by selecting "Add package from git URL..." from the add menu and 
copying the corresponding package url.  
Core: "https://github.com/mvestrand/unity-tools.git?path=/Assets/Core"  

These packages do not have any hard dependancies at the moment, but some of them will render better in the editor with the Odin Inspector plugin.
