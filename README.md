# Tools for Unity

## Overview

This is a personal collection of general purpose utilities for Unity.

## Installation

All packages here can be installed using Unity's built in package manager by selecting "Add package from git URL..." from the add menu and 
copying the corresponding package url.  
Core: 
```
https://github.com/mvestrand/unity-tools.git?path=/Assets/Core
```  

These packages do not have any hard dependancies at the moment, but some of them will render better in the editor with the Odin Inspector plugin.
